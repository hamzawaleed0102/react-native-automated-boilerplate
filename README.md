# react-native-automated-boilerplate
A react native boilerplate with built-in navigation, authentication and redux store setup.

It also includes a node.js script that allows users to quickly create new components, screens, actions and reducers with a sugar syntactic syntax.

e.g: 

`yarn new screen HelloWorld`

`yarn new component ListItem`

`yarn new appAction getBooksList`

`yarn new profileAction getBooksList`
